# Driver Name Mapping Test Guide

## What was Fixed

The manager page was displaying `driver_id` values directly instead of fetching and displaying the `full_name` from the managers table.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Database Query
- Updated the query to fetch `id`, `username`, and `full_name` from managers table
- Added dual mapping support for both `username` and `id` fields

### 2. Improved Name Resolution Logic
```dart
// Now supports both username and id mapping
final Map<String, String?> driverNamesMap = {};
final Map<String, String?> driverIdToNameMap = {};

for (var driver in allDrivers) {
  // Map username to full_name
  if (driver['username'] != null) {
    driverNamesMap[driver['username']] = driver['full_name'];
  }
  // Map id to full_name as well
  if (driver['id'] != null) {
    driverIdToNameMap[driver['id'].toString()] = driver['full_name'];
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Driver Record Processing
- First tries to find driver by `username`
- If not found, tries to find by `id`
- Provides proper fallback for unmatched drivers
- Adds comprehensive debug logging

### 4. Improved Display Logic
- Prioritizes `full_name` from managers table
- Only shows meaningful fallback messages
- Never displays raw `driver_id` values

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- Cards showed driver_id values like "ahmed_sabry", "mohammed"
- No connection to actual full names in managers table

### After Fix:
- Cards now show proper full names like "أحمد صبري", "محمد علي"
- Fallback to "سائق غير معرّف" for unmapped records
- Debug logs show successful name mapping

## Testing the Fix

1. **Run the App**: `flutter run`
2. **Navigate to Manager Dashboard**
3. **Check Driver Records Section**
4. **Verify**: Driver cards now show full Arabic names instead of usernames
5. **Check Debug Console**: Look for mapping success messages

## Database Requirements

Ensure your managers table has these sample records:
```sql
INSERT INTO managers (username, full_name) VALUES 
('ahmed_sabry', 'أحمد صبري'),
('mohammed', 'محمد علي'),
('alaa', 'علاء أحمد');
```

## Debug Output Example

Look for these messages in the debug console:
```
🔍 معالجة سجل للسائق: ahmed_sabry
✅ تم إضافة الاسم الكامل: أحمد صبري للسائق: ahmed_sabry
```

This confirms the mapping is working correctly.
